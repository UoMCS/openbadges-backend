# API

This document details the various endpoints for the Open Badges backend API.

## Response codes

The following response codes are used by the API:

 * *200*: Response completed successfully, data returned.
 * *201*: Resource (e.g. badge) created. Will also include a *Location:* header containing the address of the resource.
 * *400*: Invalid data supplied.
 * *404*: Resource not found or endpoint does not exist.

Other response codes may be returned by the server (e.g. 500 Server Error) but
these are not directly generated by the backend.

*Method:* POST

## Fetching a badge
