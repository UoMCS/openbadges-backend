# API

This document details the various endpoints for the Open Badges backend API.

## Response codes

The following response codes are used by the API:

 * *200*: Response completed successfully, data returned.
 * *201*: Resource (e.g. badge) created. Will also include a *Location:* header containing the address of the resource.
 * *400*: Invalid data supplied.
 * *404*: Resource not found or endpoint does not exist.

Other response codes may be returned by the server (e.g. 500 Server Error) but
these are not directly generated by the backend.

## Creating a badge

*URL:* `/badges`  
*Method:* POST

*Response*: 201 Created, with a *Location:* header specifying the URL of the
badge.

## Fetching a badge

*URL:* `/badges/<id>`  
*Method:* GET

*Response:* JSON representation of a badge, as per the specification.

## Creating an assertion

*URL:* `/assertions`  
*Method:* POST

*Response:* 201 Created, with a *Location:* header specifying the URL of the
badge.

Note that creating an assertion requires that the relevant badge already exists,
but an earner record will be automatically created if necessary.
